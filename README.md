# Block Mayhem

A combination of my two earlier projects - tetris and pentris into one single game.

The beginning was a video by Javidx9 about programming tetris. I then converted the code to Javascript. Later I decided to make a pentris version and add some graphics.

Controls:
Left Arrow & Right Arrow - move left & right
Up Arrow - rotate
Down Arrow - move down
Space - drop piece (no sliding after drop)
H - toggle aim assist (not avaiable in hardcore mode)
P - pause

Skill level - you start wit 3, 6 or 9 lines randomly filled with blocks
Hardcore mode - no aim assist, once in a while a random line will become scrambled
