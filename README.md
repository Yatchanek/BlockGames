# Block Mayhem

A combination of my two earlier projects - tetris and pentris into one single game.

The beginning was a video by Javidx9 about programming tetris. I then converted the code to Javascript. Later I decided to make a pentris version and add some graphics. Then i gradually expanded the game adding some other new features.

Now added cloud save functionality. I included a sample of my very very simple backend server code, which only can save and load one file.
If failed to load save from cloud, the game uses local storage of the browser.

Controls:
Left Arrow & Right Arrow - move left & right
Up Arrow - rotate
Down Arrow - move down
Space - drop piece (no sliding after drop)
H - toggle aim assist (not avaiable in hardcore mode)
P - pause

Skill level - you start with 3, 6 or 9 lines randomly filled with blocks
Hardcore mode - no aim assist, once in a while a random line will become scrambled
